Today is 23.Aug.2019. I'm in front of my computer at NsFocus.Maybe it's the last time I'm here.I wish I could find a good job in this autumn recruit.Yesterday night I talk a lot with Jacky about the future I want and the attitude to faith.Actually I don't know yet,Ijust want the things in eyes now.In my heart,I know things are wrong,but I just don't know how to face it.The Philip become more and more coward,I am really afraid of a new man he will be which is the disgusting style he dislike.
Anyway,Ijust wanna do what I should do now,sometimes I feel so tired when it goes to future.I'm running I know,but where?I don't know.

It's the night,my body's weak
I'm on the run,no time for sleep
I've got to ride,ride like the wind
To be free again
And I've got such a long way to go
To make the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind,ride like the wind
